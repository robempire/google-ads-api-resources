# google-ads-api-resources

This collection includes links to a number of resources including official guides, articles, code samples, tools, Github repo's, community forums and more focused on the Google Ads API. These are select bookmarks from a littany of open tabs that ultimately enabled me to get up and running again with the migration from the AdWords API to the Google Ads API. 

The Google Ads API is the successor to the Google AdWords API and, unfortunately, I've found documentation to be both thin and scattered despite previous experience with the AdWords API. Additionally, many of the code examples provided reference deprecated (or soon-to-be-deprecated) libraries, functions and resources. Placeholders in such code for values like developer token, private key, refresh token, etc. do not indicate how or where to acquire these. There is also minimal (or difficult to find) help when it comes to matters of scope, enpoints, and resources available via the GAQL (Google Ads Query Language).

This document will be updated over time, I hope it saves you some time.
